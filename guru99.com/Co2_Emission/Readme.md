This project will put you in a corporate development environment. You will be coding Python 
application to perform Data Analysis on CO2 Emission for different countries. You will 
create & execute the code and have an opportunity to compare it Python code designed by our 
experts in real-time. 

Day 1. 

    Read CSV File and store data in the dictionary.
    Each key in the dictionary should be a string, as read from the CSV file. The value of that key will be a Python list. 
    You will use this dictionary for the next three modules.

Day 2.
    
    Take the input from user
    Extracting index of the year
    Creating the list of emission in year
    Performing the analysis
    Printing the data in required format using formatted string

Day 3.

    It's time to visualize the data. Plot the emissions data from a user-selected country. 
    You should use Python plotting library matplotlib for drawing the plots.
